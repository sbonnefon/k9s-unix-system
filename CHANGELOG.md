# Change Log

All notable changes to `k8s-unix-system` are documented in this file.

## Unreleased

- Add `--namespace` / `-n` flag to scope all watches to a single namespace, enabling use with restricted RBAC permissions.
- Add `--kubeconfig` flag to specify a custom kubeconfig file path (also respects `KUBECONFIG` env var).
- Auto-detect namespace from kubeconfig context when namespace listing is forbidden.
- Gracefully skip cluster-scoped resources (nodes) when RBAC doesn't permit access.

## [1.2.0] - 2026-03-15

- Rename binary to `kube3d` and publish to Homebrew (`brew install jlandersen/tap/kube3d`).
- Add cross-platform release builds via GoReleaser (linux, macOS, Windows).
- Add `--version` flag.
- Add details side panel for selected resources (pod, node, workload, service, ingress).
- Fix search selection for ingresses now flies to and spotlights the ingress marker.
- Simplify ingress connector lines with a trunk-and-branch layout instead of individual lines per pod.
